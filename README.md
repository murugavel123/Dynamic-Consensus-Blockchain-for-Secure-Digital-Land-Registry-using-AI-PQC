# AI-Driven-Dynamic-Consensus-Blockchain
This project presents an AI-driven blockchain framework that dynamically selects the most suitable consensus protocol in real time based on current network conditions. Unlike traditional blockchains that rely on a fixed consensus mechanism, this system integrates machine learning, federated learning, and online learning to intelligently adapt consensus behavior in response to network latency, node availability, transaction throughput, energy usage, and security requirements.

The blockchain supports multiple consensus algorithms, including PoW, PoS, PBFT, Raft, and HotStuff, and employs an ML-based prediction engine to determine the optimal consensus strategy for each block. The learning model continuously improves using live network data, enabling adaptive and resilient decision-making without centralized control. Federated learning ensures that model updates can occur across distributed nodes while preserving data privacy.

To ensure long-term cryptographic security, the system incorporates Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for transaction signing and verification, making it resistant to future quantum attacks. Additionally, a governance layer enables decentralized user approval and node management, simulating real-world blockchain administration.

This platform serves as a research and simulation environment for studying intelligent consensus orchestration, secure distributed systems, and next-generation blockchain architectures, particularly in latency-sensitive and heterogeneous network environments.
